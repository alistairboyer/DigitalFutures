## Agile

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_being agile_
- a __mindset__
- __5__ values
- __3__ principles
- __6__ practices
- __3__ patterns

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_doing agile_


__History__
- Developed by IT professionals in 2000, Utah
> __Agile Manifesto__
> - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> - Working software over comprehensive documentation
> - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> - Responding to change over following a plan


__Values__
- trust
- empathy
- respect
- openness
- courage


__Principles__
- Clarity of outcome
  - describe problem within team
  - determine overarching outcome: __north star__
- Iteration and Learning
  - break work into chunks for processing, seek feedback and metrics
- Self-Directed [Teams](#agile-teams)
  - small teams \
  trusted to solve the tasks and be accountable for their decisions \
  right people &rarr; empowered so they have the courage to produce


[__Practices__](#agile-practices): bring principles and values to life
- social contract
- mood marbles
- wall of work
- daily stand ups
- retrospective
- showcase
- Shu Ha Ri


__Patterns__: apply agile at all levels of the organisation
- __strategy and governance plan__ for business leaders to develop the direction that the company will follow
- [__operations pattern__](#agile-operations) for business operations, _i.e._ repetitive tasks
- [__program pattern__](#agile-program) for company leaders to organise projects
- steps within the patterns
  1. mobilize
  1. understand
  1. explore and strategize
  1. build, test, implement
  1. manage, evolve


__Distributed Teams__
- colocation boosts collaboration
- tools: zoom, teams, webex | mural | trello
- coordinate schedules - core hours


__Design Thinking__
- focus on user outcomes
- design thinking framework overlaps with agile



## Agile Practices <a name="agile-practices"></a>


### Social Contract
- how a team should behave
- what does a team value
- what is important
- what can a team rely on each other for
- what happens if someone violates the social contract
- informs joining members


### Mood Marbles
- simple aggregation of anonymous overview of team mood by time - red vs green
- allows simple monitoring of feelings


### Wall of Work
- track the progress of work using clear visual representation
- teams __pull__ their own work from the backlog
- the work is associated to the appropriate team member
- categories
  - backlog - planned work waiting to be done
  - in progress
  - waiting for review / testing
  - complete
- kanban カンバン (billboard)
  - similar to wall of work but focus on limiting work in progress (WIP)
  - focus on just in time delivery


### Daily Stand Ups
- what has been done since the last meeting
- what will be done by the next meeting
- raise any blockers for further attention


### Release Plan
- Establish clear vision for the product
- Backlog: holds the funnel of work needed to complete the project
- Releases: map of iterations over the whole project, when the features are created and shared
- Iterations: fixed time periods when work is completed
- First step: select activities to promote from backlog to iterations


### User Stories
- user story: as a `user` I will be able to `do this on delivery` so that `I will get this benefit`
- title
- priority
- end user
- tasks
- team members responsible
- acceptance criteria: single story
- definition of done: all stories


### Retrospectives
- what went well
- what didn't go well
- what is slowing or confusing the process


### Showcase
- present work completed
- solicit feedback from product owners, customers and stakeholders


### Shu Ha Ri しゅはり (protect-detach-leave)
- protect: implement an idea
- detach: adapt the idea until optimum
- leave: adopt idea and move on



## Agile Teams <a name="agile-teams"></a>


### __Core Team__ - members that do the work
- 5-9 people
- Empowered
- Dedicated to one team
- Cross functional - all skills required for task are in the team
<br /><br />
- Iteration Manager (IM), operations manager, team lead
  - guardian of the agile process
  - facilitate the team's work
  - fosters empowerment and creativity
  - improves productivity
  - removes blockers
  - allows team to pull their work
- Product Owner (PO), process owner, owner of work
  - customer voice
  - has product vision
  - prioritises the work
  - maximises value
  - available for guidance
  - manages stakeholders
- Subject Matter Expert (SME)
  - experts in specific topic
  - authority on their topic


### __Extended Team__ - assist when required
  - Change Manager (CM)
    - implement changes in processes
  - Agile Project/Program Manager (APM)
    - provide management, guidance and insight
  - Stakeholders (SH)
    - people with interest in project
  - Subject Matter Expert (SME)
    - additional support to those in team


### __Governance Team__ - guidance and oversight
  - Steering Committee (SC)
    - check and approve project plan
    - monitor progress
    - assess project against business case
    - prioritise deliverables
    - review and approve project development strategy
    - review and suggest solutions for critical issues
  - Sponsors(SP)
    - motivation
    - exposure for the project at a higher level
    - resolve blockages




## Agile Operations <a name="agile-operations"></a>
- Continuous, ongoing, repeatable
- No defined start or end date


### Operations Pattern
1. Request - incoming work request
1. Prioritisation - work is ordered
1. Funnel - the queue is processed
1. Delivery - the work is completed
- Bottlenecks / constraints - can only deliver as fast as the slowest part of a process
- Continuous improvement - operations can always be improved


Iterations
- Scheduled blocks of time in which the repeated work gets done


Stand-Ups
- Keep track of progress


Retrospectives
- Learn from each iteration



## Agile Programs <a name="agile-program"></a>
- Defined start or end date


### Program Pattern
  1. Idea for a project
  1. Discovery phase: extended team determines work that needs to be done and the core team needed to do it
  1. The scope is approved, the work leaves discovery phase and core team moves through a program funnel and creates a release plan
  1. Delivery commences through the program funnel, producing work in iterations
  1. Work output and delivery is monitored


### Discovery Workshop
- held as soon as people are available and discovery is approved
- in dedicated workshop space
- 1-5 days, or multiple spread over 3-4 weeks
- participants - initiator and key stakeholders
  - spokesperson for business value of the work
  - technical people and experts
  - users representative
  - client representation
- workshop outline
  1. identify problem or opportunity
  1. identify goals and how progress can be measured
  1. identify blockers
  1. identify solutions
  1. identify the work and minimum viable product (MVP)
- after workshop
  - if approved move to next phase
  - if not approved continue in discovery phase


### Program Funnel
Defining the work
- completed as a team
- shared understanding of agile
- shared understanding of the project
- social contract
- backlog creation and refinement
- levels
  - Epic - high level project features, spanning multiple iterations
  - Feature - functionality pieces of the project, spanning multiple iterations
  - Story - work that the team can complete, as a _ i will _ so I can _
  - Task
- standards and guidelines
- tool and environment setup
- release goals and planning

Release Plan
- clear vision for the product

Wall of Work
- Prioritized Backlog | Planned | Doing | Ready for Review | Done


### Delivery
Iteration Cycles: 2-4 Weeks
0. Iteration setup - define work, collect resources, create release plan, write stories, create wall of work
1. Iteration planning - select from product backlog, agree on goal
1. Backlog - create iteration backlog
1. Execute work - pull from backlog and start executing
1. Backlog refinement - update backlog, change backlog priority
1. Execute work - pull and prioritize work from the backlog
1. Daily Standups
1. Showcase - 30 min meeting every iteration - share
1. Retrospective - what went well, what needs improvement, what is puzzling
