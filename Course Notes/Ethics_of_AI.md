## 1 - __Introduction__: What is AI Ethics?

What is AI?
-  __Artifical Intelligence__ techniques that get computers to behave in an intelligent fashion. \
Generally operating unsupervised and with the ability to adapt ot learn.
- __Machine Learning__ a set of algorithms that learn to make decisions or structure data. \
Can be structured based on data (supervised and unsupervised learning); âˆ€ use trial-and-error or puncishment-reward learning approaches.


Ethics
- __Meta ethics__ - concepts
- __Normative ethics__ - determining morals
- __Applied ethics__ - moral agents and their actions
  - AI Ethics is a subcategory of applied ethics


> __Isaac Asimov__ | Laws of Robotics
>
> - 0\. Protect humanity
> - 1\. Protect humans [unless 0.]
> - 2\. Follow instructions [unless 1.]
> - 3\. Protect self [unless 1. or 2.]


Values
- Degree of importance of a thing or action
- __Extrinsic__ / Instrumental - valuable for other purposes, e.g. money
- __Intrinsic__ - more abstract, e.g. happiness, freedom, wellbeing


Norms
- Value-based priciples or imperatives: usual or expected behaviour
- __Statistic__: usual behaviour
- __Social__: how to behave for a group
- __Moral__
  - prescriptive (encouraged rules)
  - proscrpitive (banned rules)
- __Legal__


Statments
- __Normative__ - "should be"
- __Sescriptive__ - "is"


> __David Hume__ | Guillotine
>
> We should not make normative statements about what should be based on descriptive statements of what is.


AI Ethical Frameworks
1. Non-maleficence
1. Responsibility and accountability - of system creators
1. Transparency
1. Justice / fairness
1. Respect for rights


AI Ethical Questions
- Should AI be used for good and not for harm?
- Who is responsible when harm is caused?
- Should AI be fair?
- Should AI respect and promote human rights?
    

<br /><br />


## 2 - __Non-maleficence__: What Whould We Do?

Definitions
- __Beneficence__ do good
- __Non-maleficence__ do no harm
- __Tech solutionism__
technology problems can always be fixed by more technology - _Evgeny Morozov_

AI has generally been concerned with non-maleficence. \
The result is that deep ethical problems are not considered.


> __Jeremy Bentham__ | Utilitarianism
>
> Benefits are actions that maximise well-being across those affected.\
> A version of consequentialism - only consequences are judged right and wrong.
>
>
>   What Should We do:
>   1. identify possible actions
>   2. estimate benefits and harm
>   3. select action that gives greatest benefit


Types of Utilitarianism
- Focus on individual: __egoism__
- Weight the consequences: __prioritarianism__
- Focus on results: __act utilitarianism__
- Conform to utilitarianism rules: __rule utilitarianism__


Problems with Uitilitarianism
- __Diminishing marginal utility__ utility of items decreases as their supply increases
- Requires assignment of values
- Subjective: benefits are personal and culture-dependant
- Non-static: benefits change over time
- Over-simplification: real world is complex, with unforseeable challenges
- Skips other moral considerations: requires a ranking of considerations


> __Robert Nozick__ | Utility Monster
>
> A creature that gets _more_ pleasure out of averything than everyone else.\
> Therefore, we are morally obligated to let the monster consume _everything_ because it gets the most pleasure.


Common Good and Well-Being
- Long-standing question, Aristotle pondered _the good life_
- __Subjective__: how people feel about their lives
- __Eudaimonic__: remove "peasure-seeking" measures and focus  
- __Social__: ocial coherence and acceptance


<br /><br />


## 3 - __Accountability__: Who Should be Blamed?

Definitions
- __Automated__ systems have well-defined parameters and restrictions in what tasks they can perform.\
  Their output depends on predefined heuristics or rules
- __Autonomous__ systems have the capability to learns and adapt to thier function
- __Moral agent__ a person that is responsible for their actions


What is Accountablity?
- __Actions__ doing something
- __Omissions__ NOT doing something


Dimensions of AI Accountability
- Who chooses the AI features?
- Who is accountable for the AI features?
- Who is accountable for the impact?


Who is Accountable?
- __Moral__: an actor is responsible if they can be blamed
- __Legal__: an actor is responsible if they can be penalised within the legal system


__Moral Autonomy__ requisites:
- Ability to evaluate consequences
- Capacity to act independently / objectively
- Authenticity to the responsiblity
- Sufficent capability, i.e. and cognitive skill and training


>  __Immanuel Kant__ | Moral Responsiblity
>
>  Actions are based on free will to conform to morals\
>  Reason is the source of morality\
>  Need to respect others' free will and autonomy

  
Individuating Responsibility
1. Intelligent technology gives __more computational power__ to make decisions;\
BUT also obscures decisions and assumes some decision making responsibility.
2. Technology can be persuasive, overriding volunteriness.


<br /><br />


## 4 - __Transparency__: Should We Know How AI Works?

Definitions
- __Transparency__: details about the inner workings of a system
- __XAI__: The explainability of AI


Why Transparency?
- Justification of decisions (and allow  appeals)
- Right to know
- Consequences of actions


Transparency as a Property:
- __Simulatability__: understanding the function, reproduce the output
- __Decomposability__: understanding the role of individual components
- __Algorithmic transparency__:  visibility of the inner workings


Features that make a System a Black-Box (Non-Transparent)
- Complexity, e.g. built over generations
- Difficult to explain, e.g. LLM
- Designed non-transparency, e.g. security through obscurity


Challenges of Transparency
- Algorithms are __complex__, e.g.  equations
- Code is __complex__, e.g. `i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 );`
- Comphrensibility depends on __language/culture__


Making Transparency
- Use simple models (sacrifice results)
- Explain complex models with equavalent simpler ones
- Demonstrate function: track outputs vs inputs
- Design with user focus
- Follow best-practice and new research


Openness
- Transparency is a modern socio-economic ideal, a normative demand of technology (Koivisto 2016)
- Framed in open-data, open-government, open-science, etc.

## 5 - __Human Rights__

Human Rights
- Shared __norms__ of human morality
- Justified fully by __strong reasons__
- Grounded in __agency__ and __autonomy__
<br /><br />
- Civil and political rights
- Social, cultural and economic rights
- Should take priority over other considerations
<br /><br />
- Legally implemented at national level (aka civil or constitutional rights)
- Legally recognised at international level
  - [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights) [Paris, 1948]
  - [European Convention on Human Rights](https://www.echr.coe.int/european-convention-on-human-rights) [Council of Europe, 1950]
  - [UK Human Rights Act, 1998](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents)
<br /><br />
- Human rights can have priority within themselves, e.g. right to life often placed before other rights



Right to Personal Data
- Many suggest that right to controlling "own" data is a human right
- What is a person's "own" data? Does data derived from "own" data still belong to that person?
- Manage by defining right to control "reasonable inferences" from personal data


General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR]
- European and UK legislation to protect personal data
- Right to be informed about use of personal data
- Right to access data
- Right to recitification, to correct or delete personal data
- Right to restriction, to have control over how data is processed


GDPR Data Principles
- Lawfulness, fairness, transparency
- Purpose limitation
- Data minimisation
- Accuracy (and up to date)
- Storage limitaion (deletion after finished)
- Integrity and confidentiality
- Accountability, defined roles of data
  - data subject, is the person whose data is colelcted
  - data controller, is the person or organisation using data
  - data processor, is the person or organisation acting for the data controller


Protecting Data - Anonymisation
- Generalization, using ranges instead of values
- Pseudonymization, using unrelated e.g. codes to represent data
- Synthetic data, creating artificial datasets instead of using the original data


AI and Human Rights
- AI should __not__ be used to violate human rights
- AI should not prevent people from enjoying human rights
- AI can be a __threat__ to human rights
  - AI has the power to extend the reach of "reasonable inference"
  - AI exposes data to safety risks: "Nobody could have seen _that_ happening!"
  - Constant surveillance produces negative effect, and limits freedom, see [panopticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon)
- AI can be used to __enhance__ human rights and safety
  - Remove dangers of working in hazardour environment, e.g. bomb disposal
  - Contribute to understanding (therefore, combatting) climate change
  - Give unprecedented access to disabled people, e.g. "describer" apps for visually impaired using the phone's camera
  - Remove language and understanding barriers
  - Promote inclusion through opening access to technology


The Convention on the Rights of the Child (<18) [CRC]
- All children are equal
- Childs' interests are in decision-making
- A child is entitiled to a good life
- Views of a child should be considered
<br /><br />
- These rights are the __obliagtion__ of adults
- Parents and guardians have primary responsibilty
  - They are entititled to support in decision making
- Failings should be monitored and handled by society (the state)
<br /><br />
- No explicit consideration of AI


<br /><br />


## 6 - __Fairness__: Should AI be Fair and Non-discriminative?

> __John Rawls__ | Fairness
>
> - Fairness is crucial to the stability of society (or any group)

<br />

> __Immanial Kant__ | Fairness
>
> - Humans have equal dignity

<br />

Equality and Equity
- __Equality__: everyone is gets the same resources and opporinunities
- __Equity__: everyone gets resources to reach an equal outcome

Equity vs Equality [https://interactioninstitute.org/illustrating-equality-vs-equity/]
![Equity vs Equality [https://interactioninstitute.org/illustrating-equality-vs-equity/]](https://interactioninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/IISC_EqualityEquity.png)


Justice
- __Distributive__: ensure benefits and burdens equally distributed
- __Retributive__: appropriate punishments
- __Compensatory__: appropriate compensation for injuries


Discrimination
- difference of treatment based on an individual's membership of a group
- difference of treatment based on perceived membership of "socially salient" group (Lippert-Rasmussen 2014)


Harms
- __Allocative__: individuals suffer through imbalance in distribution of resource, _e.g._ women not receiveing as many job interviews as men; different public services in area depending on affluence.
- __Representational__: groups are not represented, their voice is not heard.


Origins of Bias
- Statistics - non reperesentative sample - discrepency between sample and population
- Cognitive science - label bais - models skewing output
- Social justice - cultural unawareness - discrepancy in treatment of people


Removing Bias
- Anticlassification - specifically exclude problematic variables
- Resampling - use a sample that has a equal weight of examples across different groups


Discrimination and Bias in AI
- Word Embeddings [(Bolukbasi)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1607.06520)
  - map relationships between word: $ \overrightarrow{man} - \overrightarrow{woman} \thickapprox \overrightarrow{brother} - \overrightarrow{sister} $
  - builds in bias from training set: $ \overrightarrow{he} - \overrightarrow{she} \thickapprox \overrightarrow{boss} - \overrightarrow{librarian} $
  - very simple algorithm
- Amazon Recruitment [(Dastin)](https://www.reuters.com/article/amazoncom-jobs-automation/insight-amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSL2N1VB1FQ/)
  - Train HR system based on CVs
  - Penalized "women's" (e.g. "women's chess club captain") and woman-only educational institutes
  - Project scrapped
- Credit Score [(Rutkenstein, Velkova)](https://algorithmwatch.org/en/automating-society-2019/finland/)
  - The Finnish Non-Discrimination Ombudsman ruled an application that had been rejected based on age, gender (male), mother-tongue (Finnish), and residance (rural); to be unlwaful.

__Ethics Washing__
- Ethics policies for vanity rather than any performative benefit.
>
>_We found that explicitly instructing participants to consider the ACM code of ethics in their decision making had no observed effect when compared with a control group._
>
> [[McNamara, 2018]](https://doi.org/10.1145/3236024.3264833)

<br />

> __John Austin, Judith Butler__ | Performativity
>
> Capacity for words to have impact e.g. declarations.


__Ethics Bashing__
The three aspects used when criticising company ethics policy for ethics washing:
- Calls for Deregulation: policies can be seen as support for self-policing to avoid regulation
- Guidelines as Assurances: policies are for investors and customers
- Guidelines as expertise: ethics policies are to demonstrate expertise rather than application
