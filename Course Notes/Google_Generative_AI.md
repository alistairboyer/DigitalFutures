## Introduction to Generative AI


### Google Generative AI Course - Learning Objectives
- Generative AI Definition
- Generative AI Operation
- Generative AI Models
- Generative AI Applications


### AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
- AI is a branch within computer science
- AI is building computer systems that think and act as if they have human intelligence
- ML is training computers to predict and learn based upon data
- ML can learn and improve based on the dataset
- DL is a subset of ML
- Dl  uses artificial neural networks that can process more complex patterns than machine learning
- Generative AI is a subset of DL - it use that leverages both supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised methods
- Large Language Models are a type of generative AI


### Discriminative vs Generative
- Discriminative
    - used to classify or predict
    - usually operates using labelled data
    -
$ y $ is a number, class or probability

- Generative
    - generates data similar to data it has been trained on
    - understands data distribution and probability to build a
    - builds a __foundation model__
    - generates new content based on the foundation model
    -
$ y $ is language, audio, images
    

### Transformers
- Input $ \to $ Transformer [Encoding $ \to $ Decoding] $ \to $ Pre-trained Transformer Model $ \to $ Output
- Hallucinations
  - Examples
    - Factually incorrect
    - Sensibly incorrect
    - Grammatically incorrect
  - Causes
    - Not enough data
    - Noisy data
    - Not enough context
    - Not enough constraints
- Prompts
  - Short piece of input text
  - Determines quality and content of output


### Model Types
- Text $ \to $ Text
  - Translation
  - Creating a Summary
  - Correction
  - PaLM: Pathways Language Model; LaMDA: Language Model for Dialogue Applications; GPT
- Text $ \to $ Image (Video, 3D)

## Large Language Models

### Terminology
- _Large_: training dataset __AND__ parameter count
- Few shot: models with minimal training data
- Zero shot: recognise input that has not been taught
- Prompt Design: creating a prompt that achieves the desired task
- Prompt Engineering: optimizing a prompt for efficient use of the LLM


### LLMs
- Not many organisations have resources to create LLM $\to$ use LLMs created by large organisations and fine tune them
- Performance grows as more data and parameters are added
- Can use LLMs without expertise in ML and shortcut the compute time of model generation
- Types
  - Generic: next word predictor
  - Instruction Tuned: respond to instructions
  - Dialogue Tuned: focused on conversation
  - Chain of through reasoning: models are better at getting the desired answer when they explain their working


### Google PaLM - Pathways Language Model
- 540 billion parameters
- dense decoder-only model
- uses __Pathway__ architecture - single model trained across multiple tasks


### Transformer Model
- Encoder $\to$ Decoder


### Application of Models
- Tuning
  - Need to train model on custom data for specific task
- Fine Tuning
  - can be expensive and unrealistic
- Parameter-efficient tuning methods (__PETM__):
  - prompt tuning


### Challenges
- Hallucination - generation of unrealistic responses
- Factuality - incorrect information
- Anthropomorphisation - presenting human features from inanimate objects, including LLMs


# AI Ethics

## AI Ethics and Business


> PricewaterhouseCoopers suggests that AI could boost global GDP by 14%, or up to $15.7 trillion, by 2030


### Staying Ahead of the Curve. The Business Case for Responsible AI
- A report from Google developed by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)
- EIU Report: https://www.eiu.com/n/staying-ahead-of-the-curve-the-business-case-for-responsible-ai/
- Capgemini Research: https://capgemini.com/research/ai-and-the-ethical-conundrum/
1. Incorporating responsible AI practices is a smart investment in product development
  - 97% of respondents agree ethical AI reviews are important
  - 90% AI organisations encounter ethical issues [Capgemini]
  - 40% abandoned project after having ethical issues
  - Incorporating ethical considerations early helps reduce costs from fixing downstream problems
  - Companies that have deployed AI are 1.7 $\times$ more likely to be guided by responsible AI
  - Responsible AI creates trust with stakeholders and boosts value to users; and competitive advantage
2. Responsible AI trailblazers attract and retain top talent
  - Top workers are 400% more productive on average; and 800% more productive in complex occupations
  - Responsible AI is a key consideration for top talent [Deloitte]
  - Responsible AI helps trust between employee and employer
3. Safeguarding Promise of Data
  - 90% of customers will avoid a company with a data breach
  - Average data breach costs $3.92 [up to $8.19 in the US]
  - 36% of cost of data breach is lost business
  - Customers blame data breach on organisations rather than hackers
  - Building trust means more data is trusted to an organisation leading to better models
  - \\$1 investment in data security generates \\$2.70 return
4. Prepare in advance of AI regulation
  - Governments are actively developing AI policy
  - Reduce risk of non-compliance
  - Contribute to regulation conversation
  - Example - organisations were not prepared for GDPR by factor of 2.71 $\times$ \
  Only 13% of damage was fines, with rest being productivity loss and disruption
5. Responsible AI can improve revenue growth
  - 91% organisations have requirement for responsible AI in proposal process
  - 66% have decided to avoid working with vendors with ethical concerns
  - 66% customers willing to pay more for ethical goods and services
6. Powering up partnerships
  - Investors have increasing emphasis on ethical beliefs
7. Maintain strong trust and branding
  - Not just negative effects from lack of ethics but image bonus from having responsible AI









## AI Ethics

See also, notes on [Ethics of AI!](Ethics_of_AI.md)


### AI Ethics
- Articulating values and justiyfing actions based on those values in the form of \
rights, obligations, benefits and virtues


### Ethical Concerns
- Transparency: AI systems are highly complex by design; Transparency is important for users trust; Transparency is important for developers to control output
- Unfair Bias: AI can amplify unfair bias, it is trained on data that is subject to societal bias
- Security: Bad actors can exploit vulnerabilities and the impact increases as AI is more widely adopted. Also AI brings new challenges such as deepfakes.
- Privacy: AI can quickly combine and analyse data, giving rise to unwanted personal identification
- Pseudoscience: AI can be applied to unscientific practices such as face analysis for criminal risk
- Accountability to People: There should be mechanisms for intervention and feedback
- Unemployment and deskilling: society has faced technological advances but AI is advancing at a greater rate than ever before. This creates a challenge to adapt roles that work with AI


### AI Can Contribute to Ethical Problems
- Improving materials, designs and processes
- Increase affordability
- Provide freedom from repetitive tasks
- Spotting inequality


### AI and Responsibility
- AI can be harmful
- Responsible AI is being defined by individual organisations but there are common themes
  - Transparency
  - Fairness
  - Accountability
  - Privacy
- AI is not responsible, it is created and applied by individuals who are responsible
- Trust is an important part of AI products and relies on responsible AI


### Sources of Ethics Problems
- Lack of resources
- Lack of diversity in teams
- Lack of ethical framework


### Ethics Spotting
- To address ethical concerns, they must first be identified
- Decision trees and checklists are not suited to this task, due to emerging risks from fast developing technology
- Need to appreciate ethics at all levels and incorporate ethics conversation into all parts of development





## AI Ethics at Google

### Google's AI Ethics
- https://cloud.google.com/responsible-ai
- Began in 2017 when Google was designated an AI-First organisation
- Driven by individuals across all backgrounds within Google
- Built a list of considerations based on research: scientific literature and general opinion on concerns within AI; and portrayal of AI in media, including science fiction
- Compare with outside expertise from lawyers and AI ethics researchers to identify gaps
- Iterate and improve
- Include 4 areas not to pursue as guard-rails
- Incorporated into daily practice


### Google's Ethics Principles
- https://ai.google/principles/
- https://blog.google/technology/ai/ai-principles/
1. AI should be socially beneficial
  - manage severity, likelihood and extent to diminish risk
1. AI should avoid creating and reinforcing bias
  - monitor for representation within data (and lack thereof)
1. AI should be build and tested for safety
  - limit reliance on technology
1. AI should be accountable to people
  - informed user consent
1. AI should incorporate privacy by design
  - protect data that identifies individuals
1. AI should uphold high standards of scientific excellence
  - create credible output that passes rigorous scientific standards
1. AI should be made available (according to these principles)
  - accountability

- AI not to be used for harm

- Customer AI deal review: considers early stage of projects and investigates if has clashes with ethical principles
  - Ethics by design
  -  Preliminary review - meetings every two weeks
  - Review brief - intended goals, business problem solved, data being used, model and monitoring details, societal context, risks and harms, alignment plan (to ethics principles)
  - Discuss and align with alignment plan
  - Final approval of alignment
- Cloud AI development review: monitor scope, assessment and governance of projects before release
  - Sales deal submission
  - Preliminary review (by AI principles and responsible innovation teams)
  - Review, discuss and decide, careful consideration of deal: go forward, don't go forward, add certain requirements, escalate
- Tackling AI Problems
  - Narrow scope
  - Launch with allow list
  - Provide added educational materials


### Case Study - Celebrity Recognition

- Safeguards:
  - Allow list
  - Extended terms of service
- Fairness analysis: evaluate recall and precision
  - Found bias - skin tone labels were incorrect (https://gendershades.org) [<a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf">Research Article</a>]
  - Relabelled the skin tones according to the Fitzpatrick skin type scale
  - Errors persisted, focussed on small set of black actors and had difficulty with associating them across age ranges
  - Solved by extending dataset to include those actors at more stages throughout their careers
  - Today, Google has released the <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/monk-skin-tone-scale/">Monk Skin Tone (MST) Scale</a>




### Issue Spotting
- Guide required - but not simple checklist - focus on questions that promote critical thinking
  - Purpose and importance
  - Social benefit
  - Potential for misuse


### Best Practices
- Diverse review committee that represents user base
- Organisation-wide adoption of responsible AI practices from the bottom up
- Transparency in the governance process - track the decision-making process
- Psychological safety - confidence to explore what if - but grounded in technical and business challenges
